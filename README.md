# Emission_Prediction_and_Classification

This project addresses multiclass classification and regression task, aiming to predict vehicle emissions and classify CO2 rating based on various vehicle characteristics. 

This project leveraged Pandas and NumPy libraries for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning, along with visualizations using seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly.

Statistical techniques like ANOVA and Pearson's correlation were applied, and principal component analysis with Mutual Information was used for feature selection. 

Predictive models for CO2 emissions and rating classifications were developed using regression and classification algorithms such as Linear/Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Model were fine-tuned hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision recall, F1 score, ROC curve, RMSE, MSE, R2 score were utilized for evaluating the model.
